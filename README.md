# Data-Analyst-Job-Postings---Python

This individual project was completed for my Master of Science in Computer Science program, as part of the course “Data Analysis, Decision Making, and Visualization.”

Project Objective:
The project objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis and visualization of a dataset comprising Data Analyst job 
postings, sourced from Kaggle. This dataset serves as a valuable resource, offering a wide range of information about job 
requirements, skills, demographic locations, and more, related to Data Analyst positions. The goal of this project is to extract 
actionable insights from this dataset, benefiting job seekers, hiring managers, and recruiters in the dynamic Data Analyst 
job market.

Data Source: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search

Process of Data Analysis and Methods:
1] Data Gathering: This project will show in detail the skills needed to become a Data Analyst, and various other 
details involving the Gsearch_jobs of Data Analyst Job Postings which was taken from Kaggle - considering various 
factors. This step involves collecting the dataset from Kaggle. This process includes data extraction and potential 
transformations to ensure that the data is suitable for analysis. Maintaining data integrity is a top priority during this 
phase.

2] Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Data quality is paramount for reliable analysis. This project will systematically 
address errors, inconsistencies, and data issues. Techniques such as data cleansing, filling in missing values, and 
standardization will be applied to ensure that the dataset is consistent and ready for exploration.

3] Data Exploration [EDA]: The EDA phase will delve deep into the dataset. It includes activities like understanding 
the data's structure, identifying patterns, and performing in-depth analyses. Various statistical methods and 
visualization techniques will be employed to uncover insights that may not be immediately apparent.

4] Data Visualization: Visual representations such as graphs, plots such as scatterplots, charts, and other plots will be 
used to provide a clear and intuitive view of the data. Additionally, using Microsoft Power BI to make the 
visualizations interactive.

5] Statistical Analytics: Statistical analyses will be conducted to derive meaningful conclusions from the data.

6] Machine Learning Model: As part of the project's advanced phase, a machine learning model will be trained using 
the dataset. Details regarding the type of model (e.g., classification, regression) and the specific algorithms chosen 
will be provided. The model aims to facilitate more informed decision-making and a deeper understanding of the 
dataset's complexities.

Project Purpose:
To derive key insights visually from Data Analyst Job Postings Dataset, such as, understanding job market trends, skills and 
qualifications, salary insights, demographic analysis, comparison between different job role names within Data Analysis,
job posting sources, and predictive modeling using a machine learning model.
